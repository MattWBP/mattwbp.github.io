    <align='center'><p>Hello Dupe!</p>
        
        <p>Please find attached my resume and showreel as a speculative application for a Compositor position at your London studio. I'm fresh out of Framestore and will soon begin to atomise if I don't see a Nuke script. Gangs of London kicked serious butt and I'd quite like to jump aboard if you have some combination of a life changing project and a need for someone like myself</p>

        <p>I am also pretty sure I worked with Jonathan Harris many moons ago at stranger (now Nviz) with Paddy Eason. Fun times in a sweltering room on Lexington Street. Hopefully wherever you are now, you've got air conditioning. </p>
        
        <p>I've also got a bit of pipeline experience, and am currently working on some example projects for my website.</p>
        
    <p>If I've made a mistake and not attached my reel and cv, they can be found on my website at www.mattwbp.com</p>
        
    <p>Thanks,<br>
        Matt</p><p>
